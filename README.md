# BiblioFiles
A personal library catalog allowing you to keep track of your books

## Description

The DeweyDecimate team is exited to bring you BiblioFiles app - apersonal library catalog packed with features. You can scan new books into your catalog by scanning the book's barcode with your phone! The app uses ISBN lookup to get all books info so you can organize by author, publishing data and more. 

We used the lastest technologies to make our app accessible. Using Google's new cross platform framework, Flutter, we were able to make an iOS and Android app with 1 codebase. 

For our backend and DB management, we used a combo of GCP, Firebase and SQL to keep track of user data.
